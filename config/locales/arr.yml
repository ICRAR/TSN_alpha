      msg: Theskynet is currently runnin' two different projects, POGS n' Sourcefinder.
        Both projects will allow ye t' gain doubloons n' compete in theskynet leader
        boards. More importantly contributin' t' either project will help us process
        more radio astronomy data. Find out more details about each project below.

        about: theskynet POGS is a research project that uses Internet-connected computers
          t' d' research in astronomy. Our jolly crew will combine tha spectral coverage
          o' GALEX, Pan-starrs1, n' WISE t' generate a multi-wavelength Uv-optical-nir
          galaxy atlas fer tha nearby Universe. Our jolly crew will measure physical
          parameters (such as stellar mass surface density, star formation rate surface
          density, attenuation, n' first-order star formation history) on a resolved
          pixel-by-pixel basis usin' spectral energy distribution (SED) fittin' techniques
          in a distributed computin' mode. Ye can participate by downloadin' n' runnin'
          a free program on yer computer.
