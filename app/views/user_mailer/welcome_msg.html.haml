%p
  Firstly, I’d like to thank you for joining.
  Without the power of thousands of volunteer computers I would be nothing but a server sitting somewhere in a dark, cold room.

  Currently I have two different projects, theSkyNet POGS and theSkyNet SourceFinder.
  Both projects will allow you to earn credits and compete in the leader boards.
  More importantly, contributing to either project will help me process more astronomy data.
  You can learn more once you sign in to your account for the first time.

  Thank you for your valuable computing power and for playing your part in discovering our Universe.
